# Gettable Rest client

This is my weekend hack project that I'm using to learn React and related tools.
Hopefully, in the process I can come up with a replacement for the Postman REST client.

This project is based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
```

## Run for development

Run this two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```sh
npm run hot-server
npm run start-hot
```


## Package

```sh
npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

```sh
npm run package-all
```
